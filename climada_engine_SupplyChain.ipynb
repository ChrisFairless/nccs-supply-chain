Then, one needs to identify what subsectors in the MRIOT belong to the identified sector. In the case of WIOD16, we identify sebsectors ranging from position 26 to 56 as belonging to the service sector. Finally, the total exposure and direct impact are assigned to each subsector proportionally to their contribution to the sector's total production. This can be calculated with the method `calc_secs_exp_imp_shock`."
